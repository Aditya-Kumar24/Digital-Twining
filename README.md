# Digital-Twining  
🚗 Digital Twin of a Smart Mobility Car
Hackathon Project | Real-time Digital Twinning using ESP32, Unity & IoT





📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a Digital Twin system for a smart 4WD car prototype, integrating hardware (ESP32-CAM, Arduino R4) with a real-time Unity-based virtual environment. The goal is to create a synchronized digital replica of the physical car, enabling live monitoring, simulation, and analysis for applications in autonomous navigation, telemetry, and remote diagnostics.
